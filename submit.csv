1,"“The coming era of Artificial Intelligence will not be the era of war, but be the era of deep compassion, non-violence, and love.”",– Amit Ray
2,"“Artificial intelligence would be the ultimate version of Google. The ultimate search engine that would understand everything on the web. It would understand exactly what you wanted, and it would give you the right thing. We’re nowhere near doing that now. However, we can get incrementally closer to that, and that is basically what we work on.”",– Larry Page
3,"“Cyber hygiene, patching vulnerabilities, security by design, threat hunting, and machine learning-based artificial intelligence are mandatory prerequisites for cyber defense against the next generation threat landscape.”",– James Scott
4,“You have to talk about ‘The Terminator’ if you’re talking about artificial intelligence. I actually think that that’s way off. I don’t think that an artificially intelligent system that has superhuman intelligence will be violent. I do think that it will disrupt our culture.”,– Gray Scott
5,“I believe that at the end of the century the use of words and general educated opinion will have altered so much that one will be able to speak of machines thinking without expecting to be contradicted.”,– Alan Turing
6,"“Robots are not going to replace humans, they are going to make their jobs much more humane. Difficult, demeaning, demanding, dangerous, dull – these are the jobs robots will be taking.",– Sabine Hauert
7,“The ultimate search engine would understand everything in the world. It would understand everything that you asked it and give you back the exact right thing instantly. You could ask ‘what should I ask Larry?’ and it would tell you.” ,– Larry Page
8,“The key to artificial intelligence has always been the representation.”,– Jeff Hawkins
9,"“Some people call this artificial intelligence, but the reality is this technology will enhance us. So instead of artificial intelligence, I think we’ll augment our intelligence.”",– Ginni Rometty
10,"“Artificial intelligence will reach human levels by around 2029. Follow that out further to, say, 2045, and we will have multiplied the intelligence – the human biological machine intelligence of our civilization – a billion-fold.”",– Ray Kurzweil
11,“Machine intelligence is the last invention that humanity will ever need to make.” ,– Nick Bostrom
12,"“Success in creating AI would be the biggest event in human history. Unfortunately, it might also be the last, unless we learn how to avoid the risks.”",– Stephen Hawking
13,"“The pace of progress in artificial intelligence (I’m not referring to narrow AI) is incredibly fast. Unless you have direct exposure to groups like Deepmind, you have no idea how fast—it is growing at a pace close to exponential. The risk of something seriously dangerous happening is in the five-year time frame. 10 years at most.”",– Elon Musk
14,"“It seems probable that once the machine thinking method had started, it would not take long to outstrip our feeble powers… They would be able to converse with each other to sharpen their wits. At some stage, therefore, we should have to expect the machines to take control.”",– Alan Turing
15,"“If people trust artificial intelligence (AI) to drive a car, people will most likely trust AI to do your job.” ",– Dave Waters
16,"“People worry that computers will get too smart and take over the world, but the real problem is that they’re too stupid and they’ve already taken over the world.”",– Pedro Domingos
17,"“Anything that could give rise to smarter-than-human intelligence—in the form of Artificial Intelligence, brain-computer interfaces, or neuroscience-based human intelligence enhancement – wins hands down beyond contest as doing the most to change the world. Nothing else is even in the same league.”",– Eliezer Yudkowsky
18,"“Some people worry that artificial intelligence will make us feel inferior, but then, anybody in his right mind should have an inferiority complex every time he looks at a flower.”",– Alan Kay
19,"“Artificial intelligence will reach human levels by around 2029. Follow that out further to, say, 2045, we will have multiplied the intelligence, the human biological machine intelligence of our civilization a billion-fold.”",– Ray Kurzweil
20,"“I visualise a time when we will be to robots what dogs are to humans, and I’m rooting for the machines.”",– Claude Shannon
21,"“It’s going to be interesting to see how society deals with artificial intelligence, but it will definitely be cool.”",– Colin Angle
22,"“Artificial intelligence is growing up fast, as are robots whose facial expressions can elicit empathy and make your mirror neurons quiver.”",– Diane Ackerman
23,“A computer would deserve to be called intelligent if it could deceive a human into believing that it was human.”,– Alan Turing
24,"“I’m more frightened than interested by artificial intelligence – in fact, perhaps fright and interest are not far away from one another. Things can become real in your mind, you can be tricked, and you believe things you wouldn’t ordinarily. A world run by automatons doesn’t seem completely unrealistic anymore. It’s a bit chilling.”",– Gemma Whelan
25,“Why give a robot an order to obey orders—why aren’t the original orders enough? Why command a robot not to do harm—wouldn’t it be easier never to command it to do harm in the first place?”,– Steven Pinker
26,"“AI doesn’t have to be evil to destroy humanity – if AI has a goal and humanity just happens to come in the way, it will destroy humanity as a matter of course without even thinking about it, no hard feelings.”",– Elon Musk
27,"“As more and more artificial intelligence is entering into the world, more and more emotional intelligence must enter into leadership.”",– Amit Ray
28,"“I’m increasingly inclined to think that there should be some regulatory oversight, maybe at the national and international level, just to make sure that we don’t do something very foolish. I mean with artificial intelligence we’re summoning the demon.” ",– Elon Musk
29,"“As more and more artificial intelligence is entering into the world, more and more emotional intelligence must enter into leadership.”",– Amit Ray
30,"“I’m more frightened than interested by artificial intelligence – in fact, perhaps fright and interest are not far away from one another. Things can become real in your mind, you can be tricked, and you believe things you wouldn’t ordinarily. A world run by automatons doesn’t seem completely unrealistic anymore. It’s a bit chilling.” ",– Gemma Whelan
31,"“The upheavals [of artificial intelligence] can escalate quickly and become scarier and even cataclysmic. Imagine how a medical robot, originally programmed to rid cancer, could conclude that the best way to obliterate cancer is to exterminate humans who are genetically prone to the disease.”",– Nick Bilton
32,"“The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race….It would take off on its own, and re-design itself at an ever-increasing rate. Humans, who are limited by slow biological evolution, couldn’t compete, and would be superseded.”",– Stephen Hawking
33,"“We must address, individually and collectively, moral and ethical issues raised by cutting-edge research in artificial intelligence and biotechnology, which will enable significant life extension, designer babies, and memory extraction.”",– Klaus Schwab
34,"“If the government regulates against the use of drones or stem cells or artificial intelligence, all that means is that the work and the research leave the borders of that country and go someplace else.”",– Peter Diamandis
35,"“The real question is, when will we draft an artificial intelligence bill of rights? What will that consist of? And who will get to decide that?”",– Gray Scott
36,"“By far, the greatest danger of Artificial Intelligence is that people conclude too early that they understand it.”",– Eliezer Yudkowsky
37,"“If we do it right, we might be able to evolve a form of work that taps into our uniquely human capabilities and restores our humanity. The ultimate paradox is that this technology may become a powerful catalyst that we need to reclaim our humanity.”",– John Hagel
38,"“I’m increasingly inclined to think that there should be some regulatory oversight, maybe at the national and international level, just to make sure that we don’t do something very foolish. I mean with artificial intelligence we’re summoning the demon.”",– Elon Musk
39,"“I don’t want to really scare you, but it was alarming how many people I talked to who are highly placed people in AI who have retreats that are sort of ‘bug out’ houses, to which they could flee if it all hits the fan.”",– James Barrat
40,"“We have seen AI providing conversation and comfort to the lonely; we have also seen AI engaging in racial discrimination. Yet the biggest harm that AI is likely to do to individuals in the short term is job displacement, as the amount of work we can automate with AI is vastly larger than before. As leaders, it is incumbent on all of us to make sure we are building a world in which every individual has an opportunity to thrive.”",– Andrew Ng
